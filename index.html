ACM VIT student chapter was started up in October 2009 by Kuldeep Singh. Since then we at the ACM VIT student chapter have carried on the legacy of ACM international.</p> <p>ACM brings together computing educators, researchers, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the field's challenges. As the world’s largest computing society, ACM strengthens the profession’s collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence. ACM supports the professional growth of its members by providing opportunities for life‐long learning, career development, and professional networking.</p> <p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Every year we impart knowledge to hundreds of students and help them understand how they can contribute to the field of computing science. We conduct several technical events in a year. We nurture the growth of inquisitive minds by providing them with the toolkit to excel in various fields.</p></div><div class="wrapper grey"> <section id="calendar" class="spied scrollable target"> <header class=""> <h2>Events</h2> <p>All our events are full of fun and guaranteed to be fantastic learning experiences.</p> </header> <!--To add or modify events, modify: defcss1.css 1199 myjs.js --> <div class="list upable eveupdiv"> <h3>2016</h3> <ul class="unstyled-list"> <li class="clearfix" id="eveliid1" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#evecol1"> <div class="date"> 17 March 2016 </div> <div class="place">TechJAM - <span> Apple vs FBI Encryption debate. </span> </div> <i class="fa events3dots"></i> </li> <div class="evecol collapse" id="evecol1"> <p>ACM presents an opportunity to all technical freaks, gadget gurus and debate lovers, voice your opinion on technical issues raging across the world.
